### Limiter ###

A limiter designed to deal nicely with disproportionate transients in the signal. More information.

### Transient Architect ###
A transient processor which works somewhat like a compressor without thresholds. More information. Please use version 2!

### Driver ###
A simple overdrive plugin based on the htan (hyperbolic tangent function) function. More information.

### Chop Liver ###
Distortion inspired by an SSE ordering bug. It chops the signal into small bits which are mixed in with the dry signal in reverse order.

## Experimental ##

The following plugins might be broken and thus to be used with caution. Also their characteristics might change in subsequent releases.


### Limiter 2 ###
An improved(?) version of the limiter, but sadly it was in development years ago and it is unclear whether it is finished or not.

### Saturator ###
More distortion. It's based on something. I'm sure I have an irc log somewhere which would tell me what it does ..

### t00b Limiter ###
Some sort of experimental limiter based more on distortion characteristics than gain envelopes.
